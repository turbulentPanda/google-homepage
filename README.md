*Project Motivation*:
I created this project to practice HTML5, CSS, and git.

*What I Learned*:

Key Technologies/Techniques in Brief: CSS Grid, Flexbox

My focus for this project was page layout and positioning. I used CSS Grid and Flexbox to accomplish this and thought that the project was excellent practice to this end!

The other key takeaway from this project was how to plan the construction of a webpage from beginning to end. Sketching the page on paper and identifying the key microcomponents (e.g., header, navbar, footer, etc.) really sped up the project. While it involved a small time-investment at the beginning, it repaid itself several fold over when it actually came time to code the project.
